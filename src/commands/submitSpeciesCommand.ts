            You're about to begin the process of submitting a new animal species to The Beastiary.
            Please read over the following fields and prepare your submissions for them in advance.
            
            1) Common name(s): The names used to refer to the animal in everyday speech. E.g. "raven", "bottlenose dolphin". **At least one is required.**
            2) Image(s): Pictures used to clearly depict the animal's appearance. Imgur links only. **At least one is required.**
            3) Scientific name: The taxonomical name of the animal. If the animal's common name refers to multiple species, pick the most relevant one. **Required.**
            4) Description: A brief description of the animal's appearance, attributes, and behaviors. **Not required.**
            5) Natural habitat: A brief description of the animal's natural environment, both in ecological traits and geographic location. **Not required.**
